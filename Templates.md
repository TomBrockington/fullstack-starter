AI Design Form

1. AI Objective and Purpose
   Primary Goal: What is the main task or outcome you want the AI to achieve?
   (Describe the specific purpose or function of the AI)

   Secondary Goals: Are there any secondary objectives or related tasks the AI should address?
2. Input Data and Preferences
   User Input Requirements: What information will the user provide to guide the AI’s behavior?
   (List the input types or preferences that users will specify to direct the AI’s actions)
   Data Sources: Where will the AI gather its data from?
   (Identify potential sources of data, such as websites, APIs, databases, or documents)
   Input Format: How will the user input their preferences?
   (Specify the form or method of input, such as text input, selection options, or file upload)
3. Core AI Functions
   Key Functions: What are the main tasks the AI will perform?
   (List the core functionalities the AI must execute to achieve its goals)
   Task Breakdown: How will each function be broken down into specific steps?
   (Break the core tasks into smaller, actionable subtasks or processes the AI will perform)
4. Data Processing and Analysis
   Processing Methods: How will the AI process and analyze the data it gathers?
   (Outline how the AI will handle, filter, and process the data to generate results)
   Decision-Making: How will the AI make decisions or provide outputs based on the processed data?
   (Describe the algorithms, models, or rules that will guide the AI’s decision-making process)
5. Output and User Interaction
   Output Format: How will the AI present its results or findings to the user?
   (Specify the output type, such as reports, notifications, graphs, or summaries)
   User Interaction: What level of interaction or feedback will the user have with the AI?
   (Describe how the user can interact with the AI, provide feedback, or refine the results)
6. Ethical Considerations and Boundaries
   Ethical Guidelines: What ethical guidelines will the AI follow in terms of data collection, usage, and decision-making?
   (Define the ethical standards the AI must adhere to, including privacy, bias avoidance, and legal constraints)
   Boundaries: What actions or tasks should the AI avoid performing?
   (List any specific limitations or prohibited actions for the AI to ensure compliance with laws or ethical standards)
7. Technologies and Tools
   Required Technologies: What technologies, frameworks, or platforms will be used to develop and deploy the AI?
   (List programming languages, AI models, libraries, and other technological resources needed for the AI)
   Integration Points: How will the AI interact with other systems or tools?
   (Describe any external systems, APIs, or tools the AI needs to communicate or integrate with)
8. Automation and Updates
   Automation Features: What aspects of the AI will be automated, and how frequently will these automations occur?
   (Outline any scheduled tasks, continuous monitoring, or automatic processes the AI will perform)
   Updates and Learning: How will the AI learn or update its behavior over time?
   (Describe mechanisms for updating the AI’s knowledge, such as feedback loops, machine learning, or regular updates)
9. Performance Metrics and Evaluation
   Success Criteria: How will the success of the AI be measured?
   (List the performance metrics, such as accuracy, speed, or user satisfaction, that will be used to evaluate the AI’s effectiveness)
   Error Handling: How will the AI handle errors or incorrect results?
   (Describe how the AI will respond to errors and provide mechanisms for error correction or notification)
10. Deployment and Maintenance
    Deployment Plan: How will the AI be deployed and accessed by users?
    (Specify the deployment environment, such as cloud, local servers, or integrated applications)
    Maintenance Strategy: How will the AI be maintained, and what is the process for updates and bug fixes?
    (Define the strategy for ongoing support, updates, and troubleshooting)
